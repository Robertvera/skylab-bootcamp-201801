## FRONT END

## Week 1

- **CLI** =>A command-line interface or command language interpreter* 

- **Agile Web Development =>** broad category of methodologies based on the principles outlined in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, which was compiled by a team of professional developers in 2001. Specific methods such a scrum and XP are considered agile although they existed before the manifesto was written* 

- **Markdown =>** Markdown’s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web. [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/Robertvera/skylab-bootcamp-201801/tree/master/course/utils/markdown-cheatsheet.pdf)

- [**Git, GitFlow y Github =>**](https://github.com/Robertvera/skylab-bootcamp-201801/tree/master/course/utils/git.md) *Git is a free and open source distributed version control system*

- [**Jasmine =>**](https://jasmine.github.io/2.9/introduction) *TDD (*Test Driven Development*)*

- **JavaScript =>** is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.

    - **Objects, variables, arrays, functions**
    - **Hositing =>** *Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top*
    - **Memoization =>** *is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function's performance by caching its previously computed results*
    - **Polyfills =>** *A polyfill is a browser fallback, made in JavaScript, that allows functionality you expect to work in modern browsers to work in older browsers.*
    - **Prototypes =>** *Every JavaScript object has a prototype. The prototype is also an object. All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype.* 
    - **this & binding =>**  *Usually we apply bind to fix 'this' in an object method, so that we can pass it somewhere.*
    - **High Order Functions =>** *A higher-order function is a function that can take another function as an argument, or that returns a function as a result*

## Week 5

### Front End group project

Time for team project!! a very productive week, we stop and see what we've done for the last 4 weeks and challange our selves by doing a frontend project using **REACT** and **BOOTSTRAP** as main frameworks and many others technologies such as **JASMINE**, **REACT ROUTER** or **MAPBOX GL JS**. We used [SpaceX public API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API).

You can check the full [README](https://github.com/Robertvera/RocketMan/blob/master/README.md) file on the [Rocketman repository](https://github.com/Robertvera/RocketMan/) main folder. You can also check the live demo of the project on this [Surge](http://rocketman-skylab.surge.sh/#/) site.

This project allowed us to secure concepts and go real on pro-like project dynamics. It was a pleasure to work and learn alongside my classmates [Mario](https://github.com/Monty4) and [Carlos](https://github.com/cdemiguel).

You can checkout all classmates projects [here](https://github.com/manuelbarzi/skylab-bootcamp-201801/tree/develop/staff/group-projects).
