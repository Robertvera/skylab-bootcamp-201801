        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            You want your criminal associate taken into police custody? We declare just enough so as to not arouse suspicion, so Walt's
            one time winnings becomes seed money for an investment. If you're committed enough, you can make any story work.
            I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it. It is not a disaster. It's not
            a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living soul. You wanna know why? One word:
            blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster - for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed! You were right under
            his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids? Paging Dr. Phil! 'My
            daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!' And the house? Gone! The feds will come in and RICO her and
            the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that, noooo. It's not gonna happen. She's bluffing.
            And she knows it.

            <br> No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison.
            The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one. But you know the business and I know the
            chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up.
