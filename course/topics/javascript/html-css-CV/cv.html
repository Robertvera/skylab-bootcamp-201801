            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p class="content">
                You want your criminal associate taken into police custody? We declare just enough so as to not arouse suspicion, so Walt's
                one time winnings becomes seed money for an investment. If you're committed enough, you can make any story
                work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it. It is not a disaster.
                It's not a disaster, alright? She's not going to the cops, she's not telling a living soul. You wanna know
                why? One word: blowback. If she blabs, it'll be a disaster - for her. That DEA brother-in-law? Screwed! You
                were right under his nose. He'll be lucky if they let him bust glue sniffers at the hobby shop. The kids?
                Paging Dr. Phil! 'My daddy's a drug dealer and my mommy turned him in!' And the house? Gone! The feds will
                come in and RICO her and the kids out on the street. Good luck arguing with them on that, noooo. It's not
                gonna happen. She's bluffing. And she knows it.

                    <p>You are done. Fired. Do not show your face at the laundry again. Stay away from Pinkman. Do not go near
                        him. Ever. Are you listening to me? What do you say? For now, but he'll come around. In the meantime
                        there's the matter of your brother-in-law. </p>

                    <p>Sorry, buddy. No can do. Pain is my foot in your ass. Ooh, heyo... pool party! Hey, I don't get the gag, 
                        jackoff. Who is this? So... let me get this straight. You got this meth from 'some dude' wearing khaki 
                        pants, who - you're 80% sure - had a mustache. And that's it?

                        prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one. But you know the business
                        and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up.
